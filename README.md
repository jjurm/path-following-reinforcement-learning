# Reinforcement learning for path following

Consider the task of a problem attempting to follow a path in a constrained environment with only a few lines to follow. We attempt this using end-to-end reinforcement learning and explore two algorithms for doing so: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO). We further explore different problem formulations to learn a path-following controller or the velocities of the agent directly, and report our findings.
