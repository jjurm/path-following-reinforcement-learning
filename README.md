# Reinforcement learning for path following

Consider the task of a problem attempting to follow a path in a constrained environment with only a few lines to follow. Traditionally, this is done through planning.

We attempt to do this using end-to-end reinforcement learning.

We explore two different algorithms to learn a path controller or the velocities of the agent directly: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) and Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO).
